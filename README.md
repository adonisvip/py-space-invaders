## üöÄ Running the Game

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- Pygame library

### Installation
```bash
# Install pygame if not already installed
pip install pygame
```

### Running
```bash
# Run the optimized version
python main_optimized.py
```

## üéØ Key Improvements Explained

### 1. **Line-by-Line Code Explanation**

Each line of code is now documented with clear comments explaining:
- **What** the code does
- **Why** it's implemented this way
- **How** it integrates with other components

Example from `sprites.py`:
```python
def update(self, bullet_group, explosion_group, spaceship_group, game_manager=None):
    """
    Update spaceship state - movement, shooting, and health
    
    Args:
        bullet_group: Sprite group for player bullets
        explosion_group: Sprite group for explosions
        spaceship_group: Sprite group containing the spaceship
        game_manager: Game manager instance for sound effects
        
    Returns:
        int: Game state (-1 for game over, 0 for continue)
    """
    # Get current time for cooldown management
    time_now = pygame.time.get_ticks()
    game_over = 0

    # Handle keyboard input for movement
    key = pygame.key.get_pressed()
    
    # Left movement with boundary check
    if key[pygame.K_LEFT] and self.rect.left > 0:
        self.rect.x -= PLAYER_SPEED
```

### 2. **Separated Functions into Files**

**Before**: All code in one file
**After**: Organized into logical modules:
- `config.py`: Settings and constants
- `sprites.py`: Game objects
- `ui_manager.py`: User interface
- `game_manager.py`: Game logic
- `main_optimized.py`: Main game loop

### 3. **Added Player Name and Score Features**

**Player Name System**:
- Input field in main menu
- Validation (alphanumeric, max 15 characters)
- Displayed during gameplay and on end screens

**Score System**:
- Real-time score tracking
- 10 points per alien destroyed
- Final score display on end screens

## üîç Technical Details

### Game States
```python
GAME_STATE_MENU = 'menu'        # Main menu with name input
GAME_STATE_PLAYING = 'playing'   # Active gameplay
GAME_STATE_GAME_OVER = 'game_over'  # Player lost
GAME_STATE_VICTORY = 'victory'   # Player won
```

### Score System
- **Base Score**: 10 points per alien
- **Display**: Real-time HUD and final score
- **Persistence**: Score maintained during gameplay

### Input System
- **Name Input**: Click or Tab to focus, type name, Enter to confirm
- **Validation**: Alphanumeric characters only, 15 character limit
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid input

## üé® UI Improvements

## üîß Customization

The modular design makes it easy to customize:

### Change Game Settings
Edit `config.py`:
```python
SCREEN_WIDTH = 800  # Change screen size
PLAYER_HEALTH = 5   # Increase player health
FPS = 120          # Increase frame rate
```

### Add New Features
- Add new sprites in `sprites.py`
- Extend UI in `ui_manager.py`
- Modify game logic in `game_manager.py`

### Modify Scoring
Edit `game_manager.py`:
```python
def handle_bullet_collision(self):
    self.add_score(20)  # Change points per alien
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Assets**: Game will run with fallback graphics
2. **Sound Issues**: Game continues without sound effects
3. **Input Problems**: Check if input field is focused

### Performance Tips
- Close other applications for better performance
- Update graphics drivers if experiencing lag
- Reduce FPS in config.py if needed

## üìà Future Enhancements
